		  <h2>Han and Hindu Nationalism Come Face to Face</h2>
		  <h3>This is Todays NEWS.</h3>
		  <p>As dusk fell on June 15, a bloody clash broke out between Chinese and Indian soldiers in the Galwan Valley on the northwest China-India border, where a tributary of the Indus flows westward from Aksai Chin to Ladakh. In line with China’s recent expansionist policy elsewhere, its military had been pushing forward into territory claimed by both nations, altering facts on the ground. In line with India’s status quo policy to maintain its territorial integrity, its troops moved against Chinese intrusion, and a clash ensued. It was a throwback to the past. No one used guns, grenades or bombs. Men fought hand to hand, with fence posts, clubs wrapped in barbed wire, rods studded with nails, knives and even bayonets.</p>
		  <P>The former was used in reference to Franklin Roosevelt’s condemnation of the Japanese Empire’s bombing of Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, but the latter seemed to refer to something far more opaque, something far more fundamental to the depths of the American psyche: freedom. 

          No one seemed quite able to place it. “Protest” morphed to “riot,” “supporters” to “insurrectionists,” “insurrectionists” to “terrorists,” “real” to “surreal,” and beacon on a hill to the invocation of the 25th Amendment.

         As the riot unfolded and lawmakers were evacuated mid-ratification, as Trump supporters dared enter the Capitol with Confederate flags in hand, America was forced to reconsider–in real time–its long-held guarantees. But what happened yesterday is the echo of a bell tolled some time ago. Report for America corps members have been diligently tracking its resounding ring from locales across the country for months, and the culmination of their recent work signals a profound shift in the American landscape, a divided, angry and distrustful nation on the brink of sectarian violence.</P>
